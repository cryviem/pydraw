1) Two kind of thread: 
    regular : this thread has to self terminating, becareful with endless loop which cause the thread unstoppable 
    deamon  : be killed whenever process want to finish.

default is regular, choose deamon by specify "daemon=True" in threading.Thread()

EX: 
x = threading.Thread(target=thread_function, args=(...), daemon=True)
x.start()

2) join()
Tell current thread to wait for the x.join() thread to finish.
